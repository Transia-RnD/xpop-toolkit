# XPOP Network

This repository contains a Docker Compose file that sets up two separate chains, the Burn Chain and the Mint Chain. Each chain consists of multiple nodes, each running in its own Docker container.

## Getting Started

To start the chains, run the `up.sh` script:

```bash
./up.sh
```

This will build and start all the Docker containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

To stop the chains and remove all the Docker containers, run the `clean.sh` script:

```bash
./clean.sh
```

This will also remove all the logs and data stored in the `lib` directories of each node.

## Ports

Each node exposes several ports for communication. Here is a list of the ports used by each node:

### Burn Chain

- `burn_vmaster`: 5005, 6006, 51235
- `burn_vnode1`: 5006, 6007, 51236
- `burn_vnode2`: 5007, 6008, 51237
- `burn_pnode1`: 5008, 6009, 51238
- `burn_vl`: 80
- `burn_explorer`: 3000

### Mint Chain

- `mint_vmaster1`: 5015, 6018, 6016, 51245
- `mint_vmaster2`: 5115, 6118, 6116, 51246
- `mint_vnode1`: 5215, 6218, 6216, 51247
- `mint_vnode2`: 5315, 6318, 6316, 51248
- `mint_vnode3`: 5415, 6418, 6416, 51249
- `mint_vl`: 81
- `mint_explorer`: 3001

Please ensure that these ports are available on your machine before starting the chains.

## Volumes

Each node uses two volumes for storing logs and data:

- `log`: This directory contains the logs generated by the node.
- `lib`: This directory contains the data stored by the node.

These directories are mapped to the host machine, so you can inspect the logs and data directly from your machine.

## Networks

Two separate Docker networks are used for the Burn Chain and the Mint Chain:

- `burn-network`
- `mint-network`

Each node in a chain is connected to the same network, allowing them to communicate with each other.

## Explorers

Each chain has its own explorer running in a Docker container. The explorers are accessible on the following ports:

- Burn Chain Explorer: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Mint Chain Explorer: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

The Burn Chain Explorer is located on port 3000, while the Mint Chain Explorer is located on port 3001. You can access these explorers in your web browser to view the blockchain data and interact with the chains.

## Genesis Files

Both the Burn Chain and the Mint Chain are configured to start with a genesis file. The genesis file contains the initial state of the blockchain, including the initial account balances and other configuration parameters.

The genesis file for each chain is provided in the repository. When the chains are started, the nodes read the genesis file and initialize themselves accordingly.

If you need to modify the genesis file, you can do so by editing the `genesis.json` file for each chain. Make sure to restart the chains after making any changes to the genesis file for the changes to take effect.
